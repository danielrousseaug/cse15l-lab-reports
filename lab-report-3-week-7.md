## Part 2

It took me 2:03 minutes with vscode and around 10 seconds with just vscode.

While it was easier to do it in Vim I think it was kind of cheating since I had already mastered and practiced the perfect keystrokes to do it and I was already logged in to the SSH shell when I began timing. I think if I would have done the opposite, where I practiced editing in vscode and scping, the times would have been around the same.

Still for quick script edits I would say I do prefer VIM as I already used it before learning in this course and have found it very helpful. 

If it was a larger project however I would prefer to download it and work on it with an IDE so I could maneuver around files easier and potentially preview the project in real time, it varies a lot depending on the task I would want to do.
